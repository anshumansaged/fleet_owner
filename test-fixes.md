# Test Cases for Bug Fixes

## üêõ Issues Fixed:

### 1. WhatsApp Summary Issue
**Problem**: WhatsApp summary was showing driver salary info even when the checkbox was not checked.
**Fix**: Updated `generateWhatsAppSummary()` to conditionally show salary information based on `driverTookSalary` checkbox.

**Test Case**:
- Add a trip without checking "Driver took salary today"
- Verify WhatsApp summary shows "Status: Not taken today (Pending)" instead of "Paid Today"

### 2. Cash in Hand Not Updating with Cashier Amount
**Problem**: Cash in hand calculation didn't consider the `cashToCashier` amount.
**Fix**: Updated `calculateCashInDriverHand()` to subtract `cashToCashier` from the total.

**Test Case**:
- Add trip with:
  - Total Cash: ‚Çπ5000
  - Fuel: ‚Çπ500
  - Online: ‚Çπ1000
  - Cash to Cashier: ‚Çπ2000
- Expected Cash with Driver: ‚Çπ1500 (5000 - 500 - 1000 - 2000)

### 3. Negative Cash Detection Logic
**Problem**: Negative cash detection wasn't considering cashToCashier amount.
**Fix**: Updated the useEffect that monitors for negative cash to include cashToCashier in calculation.

**Test Case**:
- Create scenario where: Total Cash - Expenses - CashToCashier < 0
- Verify negative cash modal appears

### 4. API Cash Calculation
**Problem**: API wasn't subtracting cashToCashier from cash in driver hand.
**Fix**: Updated API route to include cashToCashier in the calculation.

**Test Case**:
- Submit trip and verify database shows correct cashInDriverHand value
